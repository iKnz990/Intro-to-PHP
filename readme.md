# Welcome to My WDV341 Repository! 🎉

## What's Inside? 🌐
Hey there! Welcome to my `WDV341` repository. This is where I keep all my PHP projects and assignments. You'll find core components, assets, and a bunch of modules that show off what PHP can do.

## The Building Blocks 🛠️
- **.htaccess**: This is how I configure my Apache Web Server.
- **core/footer.php**: This footer ties all my projects together.
- **core/header.php**: Here's where I set up my HTML headers, meta tags, and styles.
- **core/functions.php**: This is my go-to for all kinds of PHP functions.
- **core/registration/**: This is where the magic happens for user login and registration.

## The Look 🎨
- **assets/css/style.css**: This stylesheet makes sure everything looks good.

## The Fun Stuff 📦

### The Classics
1. **Definitions**: Think of this as my PHP dictionary.
2. **Form Handling**: This is where I play around with forms.
3. **PHP Basics**: Back to square one, but in a good way.
4. **PHP Functions**: Here's where PHP shows off a bit.

### The New & Improved

#### My Calendar Module 📅
- **What It Does**: It's all about managing appointments and services.
- **Cool Features**: It's got something for both admins and users.
- **How to Use**: Just go to the `calendarWidget` folder and open `index.php`.

**JavaScript Deep Dive**:  
In `view_bookings.php`, I've got some neat JavaScript that controls booking data. Functions like `showModal()` pop up edit modals, and `updateDatabase()` updates bookings with AJAX.

#### Wolfram Visualization 📊
- **What It Does**: Visualizes food data, because why not?
- **Cool Features**: Uses Wolfram API and D3.js for some cool visuals.
- **How to Use**: Head to `wolframVisualization` and open `index.php`.

#### Paypal Module 💰
- **What It Does**: This is where I handle subscriptions for monthly content audits.
- **Cool Features**: It's got a PayPal button and uses the PayPal SDK.
- **How to Use**: Just go to `paypal` and open `index.php`.
